# To run the development version:

- Install yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
- Install nvm: https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md
- I use node v7.6.0 but other ones may work. Install it and then run the package like this:

```
nvm install v7.6.0
nvm use 7.6.0
yarn install
yarn start
```

- This should open up the development web version on http://localhost:3000

# To deploy:

- Push to the master branch of this GitHub
